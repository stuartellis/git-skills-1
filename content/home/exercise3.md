# Working with branches

----

# Recap

Things that we already know...

----

# Technical

* Branches are pointers to the freshest commit on a line 
* Dirt cheap: 1Kb files
* Have as many as you want

----

# Conventions

* Branches should have owners
* Feature branches vs. integration branches

Conventions avoid confusion with many branches

----

# "Git flow" is a good set of conventions 

----

# Tags

* Tags are aliases to specific commits
* Unlike branches, they can't change (only create or delete)
* Tags must explicitly be shared: you might have local-only ones  

----

# Briefly: Trunk-based development

* A different way of thinking
